Exercise 1:

When running SimpleThread without synchronization and without random interrupts, each thread stores 
the shared value in a temporary variable, and then the thread is placed at the end of the ready queue. 
Once every thread have its own copy of the shared value, the temporary variable is incremented and 
reassigned to the shared value. Then the thread is placed back again at the end of the ready queue. 
Ultimately, the result is every thread seeing the same value on every iteration.

However, this naive approach becomes an issue when running with random interrupts, because the interrupted thread 
is not placed in the ready queue at the same time as the uninterrupted threads. So when the uninterrupted threads 
are starting the second iteration, the interrupted is waiting to increment the shared variable. Suddenly, the 
local copy of the shared value in the interrupted thread becomes obsolete, leading to inconsistent increments. 

The solution to this is to add synchronization before each thread stores the shared variable and resume after the
shared value is incremented. The result being that, despite whether threads are on different iterations because of
interrupts, we are not dealing with multiple copies of the shared variable. Ultimately, the result is each 
thread increasing the shared value five times independently.


Provide descriptions of which excercises you have been able to complete. 
Discuss the ones that are incomplete, what is their current status.

Exercise 1: Completed. We modified ThreadTest to fork n new threads and implemented SimpleThread with and without synchronization using Semaphores
Exercise 2: Completed. We implemented Locks and tested implementation on SimpleThread
Exercise 3: Completed. We completed the code for the condition variable methods
Exercise 4: Completed. We implemented elevator functionality following all constraints usings structs and methods and added synchronization between the elevator thread and all the person threads using semaphores, locks, and condition variables


Contributions:

Juan Arias:
Analyzed and explained the results of SimpleThread before the introduction of semaphore for exercise 1.
Implemented Locks and Conditions for exercises 2 and 3.
Implemented the Locks for SimpleThread in exercise 2
Added the logic that allows threads to be synchronized and allows the elevator to work as expected for exercise 4.

Franklin Bello:
Implemented the Semaphore and Barriers for exercise 1.
Explained the implementation of SimpleThreads before and after introducing semaphores for exercise 1.
Tested the following scenarios for exercise 4:
    1. Going up
    2. Going down
    3. Same floor
    4. Going up when full
    5. Going down when full

Peter Llerena:
Exercise 1: implemented semaphore and barrier to receive the correct output
Exercise 2: Implemented the lock operations and ran test by replacing semaphore from exercise 1 with lock operations in SimpleThread

Alexis Powell:
Established and created the ArrivingGoingToFrom and Elevator methods. 
Methods Implemented/Contributed: ArrivingGoingFromTo(int atFloor, int toFloor), Elevator(int numFloors), contributed to the Person method to test the PersonThreads ,and generateID(). 

Malcolm Verdier:
Implemented nachos debug in all code written to make sure it was easier to find sources of error
Modified threadtest() and Simplethread() in the threadtest.cc file to have multiple threads
Implemented locks and modifiing when it will free and when it be sleep using lock:aquire() and lock:release()
